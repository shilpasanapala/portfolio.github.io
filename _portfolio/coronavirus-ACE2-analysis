This project explores the evolutionary divergence of the ACE2 receptor — a key entry point for coronaviruses — across 10 bat and 10 non-bat species. Using R-based tools and Jalview visualizations, I assessed sequence conservation, entropy, and consensus residue shifts at 31 key positions implicated in viral binding.
Results show that while overall ACE2 conservation is high, several residues (e.g., 79, 31, 41) diverge significantly between groups, suggesting localized adaptation. These findings shed light on bat-specific evolutionary pressures and implications for zoonotic spillover risk.

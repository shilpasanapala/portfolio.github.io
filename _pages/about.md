I'm Shilpa Sanapala, a wet lab researcher with a passion for bioinformatics. My current research projects at work focus on investigating viruses at a molecular level, understanding the host immunological mechanisms in response to these viruses, and applying this knowledge to vaccine development. I am interested in applying computational techniques in R/bioinformatics to study patterns in viral evolution, cross-species viral dynamics, and, in particular, to examine the host-pathogen interactions.

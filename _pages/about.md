My name is Shilpa Sanapala, and I am a biomedical researcher based in St. Louis, Missouri. I hold a master’s degree in biotechnology from the University of Texas at San Antonio and a bachelor’s in biotechnology from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in India. Over the past decade, I have worked extensively in academic research settings, including Washington University School of Medicine, where I have contributed to projects involving vaccine development, tumor modeling, and infectious disease immunology. My work has been published in several peer-reviewed journals, including Cell Host & Microbe and Nature Communications.
Currently, I am expanding my skillset into data analytics through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am pursuing a certificate in Data Analytics. As part of my coursework, I am working on a project titled “Discovery and Characterization of Novel Bat Coronaviruses Using Public Metagenomic Datasets.” This project allows me to integrate my background in virology with data-driven approaches, using R tools such as the Sequence Read Archive to identify and analyze novel viral sequences. I am particularly interested in using data to explore questions in infectious disease surveillance and understand the genetic basis of health and disease.
